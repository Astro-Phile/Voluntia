# 🌳 Voluntia

**Voluntree** is an open-source volunteer and opportunity management platform designed to help communities, nonprofits, and organizers easily connect, schedule, and manage volunteers with clarity and compassion.

> 💡 *"Grow with purpose. Serve with Voluntree."*

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

We aim to create a fully open, transparent, and scalable volunteer management platform that helps organizations:
- Post and manage volunteering opportunities
- Match users based on interests, skills, and availability
- Schedule shifts and track engagement
- Build a strong community of impact-driven contributors

---

### 🌍 Why Voluntria?

Millions of small-scale nonprofits, college-run initiatives, local clubs, and grassroots efforts do meaningful work — but struggle to manage volunteers due to:

- Lack of free and customizable digital tools  
- Complex or paywalled platforms that don’t fit their scale  
- No way to track or retain volunteers meaningfully  
- Fragmented workflows (e.g., spreadsheets, WhatsApp, verbal tracking)

---

### 💡 What Problem Does It Solve?

Voluntree is built to solve the **gap between intent and action** in the volunteering ecosystem.  
Organizations often **want to do more** — recruit, engage, manage, and recognize volunteers — but are held back by:

- Manual volunteer tracking  
- No scheduling or reminder system  
- No history of participation or feedback  
- Inability to personalize volunteer workflows

Voluntree bridges that gap with:

- ✅ A simple platform for volunteer onboarding and task management  
- ✅ Event and role-based participation tracking  
- ✅ Geo-local discovery of volunteering opportunities  
- ✅ Transparent metrics for impact and participation  
- ✅ Two-way feedback between volunteers and organizers

---

### 🧩 Who Is It For?

- Local NGOs  
- College and university clubs  
- Grassroots civic groups  
- Charity drives and micro-campaigns  
- Any cause-driven group managing volunteers manually
